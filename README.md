# NOTE: Daffodil officially recreated on Github
In the meantime, the author of Daffodil has officially resurrected the project by [recreating the official repository on Github](https://github.com/manusoft-gh/manusoft-daffodil) himself. There he also provides a pre-built MSI installer for installing Daffodil. Definetly have a look [there](https://github.com/manusoft-gh/manusoft-daffodil) if you are interested in Daffodil!

# Daffodil
Daffodil provides native multi-targeting platform toolsets for Visual 
Studio 2010 C++ developers who need to target older versions of Visual 
Studio. Forked from https://daffodil.codeplex.com/

To use these platform toolsets, you must have the targeted version of 
Visual Studio installed. Currently supported platforms are:
- Visual Studio 2005 (VC 8)
- Visual Studio 2003 (VC 7.1)
- Visual Studio 2002 (VC 7)
- Visual Studio 6 (VC 6)

## Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015
Daffodil works fine in VS 2012 and later versions as long as VS 2010 is also installed.
